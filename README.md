## Question 1: Canny Edge Detection Manual vs Library Refer (Q1_Canny.ipynb)
I selected a frame and an ROI from it that is a corner of a LED monitor. And computed Canny Edge Detection manually and OpenCV Library.
Choice of angles in the non-maximum supression, hysterisis strong parameter all would have been , kernel size of Sobel Filter and Gaussian Blur will be optimized in the Opencv function hence a much better result

## Question 2: Harris Corner Detection manual Vs Library Refer (Q2_Harris.ipynb)

I used the same ROI as the Canny Edge since there is a corner in the scene.
I have used the exact same parameters for both the manual and OpenCv implementation as in the blocksize, kernel size , yet the result seems to be different.
