## Question 1: Canny Edge Detection Manual vs Library Refer (Q1_Canny.ipynb)
I selected a frame and an ROI from it that is a corner of a LED monitor. And computed Canny Edge Detection manually and OpenCV Library.
Choice of angles in the non-maximum supression, hysterisis strong parameter all would have been , kernel size of Sobel Filter will be optimized in the Opencv function hence a much better result
